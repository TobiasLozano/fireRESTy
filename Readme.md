# ðŸ”¥ FireRESTy

**FireRESTy** is a web client for Firebase â€” but more than that, it helps you migrate your **Firestore collections** into **MongoDB schemas**, and generates REST-like endpoints for querying and managing your data.

## âœ¨ Features

### ðŸ§© Frontend (React + Vite)
- Material UI design (similar to Firebase)
- Upload Firebase service account JSON (secure and encrypted)
- Store Firebase credentials (encrypted)
- View collections from Firestore
- Generate and edit MongoDB-compatible schemas
- Preview data tables from collections
- Export schema to:
  - **MongoDB** (BSON types, depth, required)
- Use headers to access Firebase via REST
- Drawer navigation:
  - Select project
  - View/edit schemas
  - View/edit endpoints
  - View data in tables

### ðŸ›  Backend (Express + MongoDB)
- Save generated collection schemas and endpoints
- Generate **REST endpoints**   [PostgREST-style](https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v13/) for each collection
- Support running data migration (Firestore âžœ MongoDB)

When a project is selected, you get access to next views:
### Data
Browse first 5 collections document and you can generate a mongoDB schema from that. Useful for data migration.

### Schemas
You can browse schemas generated for your selected project and check for changes over schemas previously saved.

### Endpoints
You can see the available endpoints listed from collections.

 If there is any schema saved from your collection, you will get it from here.

You can interact with your Firestore DB with these endpoints via http request from Postman, your app, microcontrollers or whatever you need.
You will get an CURL example to test it
